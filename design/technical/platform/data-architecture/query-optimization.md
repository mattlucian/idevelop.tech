Systematically optimized slow queries using EXPLAIN ANALYZE identifying missing indexes and inefficient joins. Created composite indexes for common query patterns reducing query time from seconds to milliseconds. Eliminated N+1 queries through strategic eager loading and batch fetching. Implemented bulk operations for high-volume data processing improving throughput 10x.
