## Context Section

### Title
Data Modeling Approach

### Content
Designed normalized schemas for transactional data ensuring data integrity and consistency. Applied selective denormalization for read-heavy tables improving query performance. Used foreign key constraints enforcing referential integrity while carefully managing cascade behaviors. Implemented check constraints and triggers for complex business rules not expressible through simple constraints.
