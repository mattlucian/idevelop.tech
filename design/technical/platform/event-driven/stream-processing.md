### Title
Stream Processing Usage

### Content
Implemented real-time analytics using Kafka Streams for inventory tracking and order processing metrics. Used tumbling windows for hourly aggregations and sliding windows for moving averages. Maintained stateful processing for complex event correlation. Processed streams with sub-second latency enabling real-time dashboards and alerts.
