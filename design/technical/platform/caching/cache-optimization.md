### Title
Performance Tuning

### Content
Achieved 92% cache hit rate through strategic key design and TTL optimization. Implemented connection pooling with 50 connections per application instance reducing connection overhead. Used LRU eviction policy with maxmemory settings preventing out-of-memory issues. Monitored slow queries and optimized data structures reducing P99 latency from 15ms to 2ms.
