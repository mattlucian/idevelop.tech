## Context Section

### Title
Code Generation Strategy

### Content
Used OpenAPI Generator to produce both server stubs and client SDKs from specifications. Server generation created controller interfaces and models reducing boilerplate by 70%. Published Java and JavaScript client SDKs enabling type-safe API consumption. Integration in build pipeline ensured code stayed synchronized with specifications preventing drift.
