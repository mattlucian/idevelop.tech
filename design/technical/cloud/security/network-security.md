## Context Section

### Title
Network Security Strategy

### Content
Implemented defense-in-depth with both security groups and NACLs. Security groups provided stateful application-level filtering while NACLs added subnet-level protection. Restricted egress traffic to only required destinations. Used bastion hosts for administrative access to private resources.
