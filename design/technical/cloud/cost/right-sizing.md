## Context Section

### Title
Right-sizing Strategy

### Content
Conducted comprehensive analysis of all infrastructure identifying over-provisioned resources. Reduced instance sizes for 40% of workloads after monitoring revealed consistent under-utilization. Migrated batch workloads to burstable instances. Combined right-sizing with reserved instances achieving 50% cost reduction.
